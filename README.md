# Let's Explore Bad USB with Flipper Zero!

Here, we focus on the Bad USB functionality of the Flipper Zero by writing creative and fun scripts to enhance our skills.

The Flipper Zero can act as a BadUSB device, recognized by computers as a Human Interface Device (HID), such as a keyboard. A BadUSB device can:

- Change system settings
- Open backdoors
- Retrieve sensitive data
- Initiate reverse shells
- Automate almost any task achievable via physical keyboard access

This is made possible by executing commands written in the [Rubber Ducky Scripting Language (DuckyScript)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220816200129/http://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript), commonly referred to as a payload.
For more details on Bad USB payloads, check out the [official documentation](https://docs.flipper.net/bad-usb).
